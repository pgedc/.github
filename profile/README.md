Our mission is:

1. To facilitate knowledge exchange among Postgres extension developers and provide a forum for discussing best practices and expertise in extension development.
2. To offer a platform for proposing and deliberating on upstream changes that support the present and future requirements of extensions.
3. To establish a community and representation for Postgres extension developers within the ecosystem.
